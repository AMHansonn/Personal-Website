      <h3>Engineering Student. Front-end Web Dev.</h3>
      <p>Hi, I'm Anthony Hanson. I am an engineering student who is studying to become a software engineer. My strongest aspects currently are front-end web development, but I would love to get better in all things software engineering and programming.</p>

      <p>I have some experience in languages such as:
        <ul>
          <li>HTML/CSS</li>
          <li>Python</li>
          <li>Java</li>
          <li>C/C++ (Preferance to C) (Arduino)</li>
          <li>Swift</li>
        </ul>  
      There's still much that I have to learn, but I have a little experience in these languages. I have the most experience in languages such as HTML and CSS, where I can easily create a solid front-end (not much interactivity) for a web app. I am learning how to use JavaScript for front-end, and to learn back-end I've been learning to use PHP and Python for that. 
      <br><br>
      I have also been experimenting with a project for lower-level development with languages such as C, C++, and Assembly. I'm experimenting on doing a project with an operating system, potentially even creating one.
